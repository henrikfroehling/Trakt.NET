# Installation

The recommended way to install **Trakt.NET** is to use [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org), but you can also directly link to a **Trakt.NET.dll** file or build the library from source code.

## NuGet

Navigate to your projectâ€™s directory and install **Trakt.NET** with:
```bash
dotnet add package Trakt.NET
```

Or open your project / solution in Visual Studio and use the [Visual Studio Package Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-visual-studio) and search for "Trakt.NET".

## Build from Source

You have also the option to [build the library directly from source](../references/building.md).
