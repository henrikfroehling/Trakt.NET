# Serialize Authorization

This example shows how we can serialize a given authorization as JSON data and deserialize the JSON data back to an authorization.

For this example we simply create a fake authorization.

[!code-csharp[](../../codesnippets/examples/serialization/SerializationExample.cs#L13-L13)]

We use the [`TraktSerializationService`](xref:TraktNet.Services.TraktSerializationService) to serialize the previously created authorization as JSON data.

Then, we use the [`TraktSerializationService`](xref:TraktNet.Services.TraktSerializationService) to deserialize the JSON data back to an authorization object.
