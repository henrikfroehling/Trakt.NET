This folder contains a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection of all possible [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/) [API](http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/#) requests.
The collection is saved in the file `Trakt API Requests.postman_collection.json`.

There are also two environments (`Trakt API Environment.postman_environment.json` and `Trakt API Staging Environment.postman_environment.json`).

Both are used to store different kind of variables like Client-ID and -Secret and Access Token and Refresh Token and other variables which are used in the collection.
The environments are just different in that one is for normal API usage and the other one for staging API usage.
